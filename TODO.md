# TODO
- Fix Bugs:
  - It is possible to super-jump somehow by jumping into a corner.
  - The main character's hitbox is slightly too large, which can be frustrating.

- Add another ending, if you complete the game with no deaths.

- Figure out overlay controller buttons, pointerup / pointerdown to change state or what?
